# Neural Network Implementation From the Ground UP

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a neural network, created in a Jupyter Notebook format. The project aims to provide an intuitive understanding of how neural networks work by focusing on the underlying concepts as well as providing practical coding examples. The code is written in Python, leveraging popular libraries for mathemtical manipulation and data science such as Pandas and NumPy.

## Features
- **Customizable Neural Network Architecture**: Configure the number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, and optimizers.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the neural network on sample datasets and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.
- **Visualization**: Graphically visualize training performance, including loss and accuracy.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following libraries installed:
-Python version: 3.12.4
-NumPy version: 2.0.0
-Pandas version: 2.2.3
-Matplotlib version: 3.9.0
-scikit-learn version: 1.5.1
-scikit-optimize version: 0.10.2

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/barbacci-marco/NN-from-the-ground-up.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```sh
   cd NN-from-the-ground-up
   ```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Neuralnetworkcode.ipynb
   ```
4. **Customize and Run**: Open the notebook, customize the parameters as needed, and run the cells to train and evaluate your neural network.

## Example Usage
The notebook contains sample cells for:
- Loading data (e.g., MNIST dataset for digit number recognition)
- Configuring the neural network architecture
- Training the network
- Evaluating the performance with accuracy and loss metrics

Feel free to modify the examples to use different datasets or neural network structures.
